Yeah, uh
Scarlxrd
Yeah, yeah
Young Scarlxrd, with the dough, on the come up
On my solo gang shit, pray for death if you run up
Really exist with the goats
This shits hits your dome
Hand to your throat
Going in bold since life went cold
Sitting here stoned is a method to cope
Molly and xans make my eyes roll
Ducking the plans like its 5-0
I'm in a trance, that's the high-low
I take a chance, hoping I go
Name on my fist
Can't remember who this is
