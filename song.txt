Yeah, uh
Scarlxrd
Yeah, yeah
Young Scarlxrd, with the dough, on the come up
On my solo gang shit, pray for death if you run up
Really exist with the goats
This shits hits your dome
Hand to your throat
Going in bold since life went cold
Sitting here stoned is a method to cope
Molly and xans make my eyes roll
Ducking the plans like its 5-0
I'm in a trance, that's the high-low
I take a chance, hoping I go
Name on my fist
Can't remember who this is
Holy fuck, I'm still alive after taking all this shit
Young war lxrd with a head so dark
Never see this fucking shit when I'm so fucked up
Nobody knows where my passion is
But they gon' know where the mansion is
I'm so cut throat, I can't manage it
Don't get too close, blow your ass to bits
When did my life turn to savageness?
Pick up the bond, and then plan this shit
I pop the shit in my cabinet
How can my body still handle this?
I-I-I I know that you're worried bout the time up on the clock
We all know that you're nervous
I can see it when you walk
Now you say that you want me, I'm the one that broke your heart
Bitch, cry me a river, you're not broken, you're just lost
Lxrd!
Uh, yah
Die!
I don't wanna die, but I can't fucking stand to live
Wasted all the fucking time helps me cope with this life of sin
Lie on my name say the shit that you think (ay)
Hide your face, then say that shit
Fuck
Young Scarlxrd, with the dough, on the come up
On my solo gang shit, pray for death if you run up
Young Scarlxrd, with the dough, on the come up
On my solo gang shit, pray for death if you run up
